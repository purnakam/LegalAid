                            <br> Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death,
                            or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the
                            knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable
                            homicide.
                            <br>Illustrations.
                            <br>(a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with
                            the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm,
                            treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable homicide.
                            <br>(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or
                            knowing it to be likely to cause Z’s death, induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z.
                            Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable homicide.
                            <br>(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush;
                            A not knowing that he was there. Here, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not
                            guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause death by doing an act
                            that he knew was likely to cause death.
                            <br>Explanation 1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring
                            under a disorder, disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other,
                            shall be deemed to have caused his death.
                            <br>Explanation 2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such
                            bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper
                            remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been prevented.
                            <br>Explanation 3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother’s womb is not
                            homicide. But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any
                            part of that child has been brought forth, though the child may not have breathed or been
                            completely born.</p>

                        <br> Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder,––
                        <br>(a) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing
                        death; or
                        <br>(b) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing
                        such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person
                        to whom the harm is caused; or
                        <br>(c) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing
                        bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient
                        in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or
                        <br>(d) if the person committing the act by which the death is caused, knows that it
                        is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodily
                        injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring
                        the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.
                        <br>Illustrations.
                        <br>(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits
                        murder.
                        <br>(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause
                        his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of
                        the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the
                        ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A,
                        not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the
                        ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may
                        intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or
                        such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.
                        <br>(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of
                        a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder,
                        although he may not have intended to cause Z’s death.
                        <br>(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one
                        of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any
                        particular individual.
                        <br>Exception 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the
                        power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who
                        gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident:
                        Provided that the provocation is not,––
                        <br>(a) sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or
                        doing harm to any person;
                        <br>(b) given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the
                        lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant;
                        <br>(c) given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.
                        Explanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent
                        the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.
                        <br>Illustrations.
                        <br>(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally
                        kills Y, Z’s child. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and
                        the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the
                        provocation.
                        <br>(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at
                        Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight.
                        A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide.
                        <br>(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by
                        the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing
                        done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.
                        <br>(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a
                        word of A’s deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by
                        these words, and kills Z. This is murder.
                        <br>(e) A attempts to pull Z’s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays
                        hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in
                        consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was giving by a thing
                        done in the exercise of the right of private defence.
                        <br>(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending
                        to take advantage of B’s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B’s hand for that
                        purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A
                        is guilty of murder.
                        <br>Exception 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good
                        faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by
                        law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence
                        without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for
                        the purpose of such defence.
                        <br>Illustration.
                        Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A
                        draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other
                        means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed
                        murder, but only culpable homicide.
                        <br>Exception 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant
                        or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers
                        given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be
                        lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without
                        ill-will towards the person whose death is caused.
                        <br>Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation
                        in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender’s
                        having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.
                        <br>Explanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or
                        commits the first assault.
                        <br>Exception 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused,
                        being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own
                        consent.
                        <br>Illustration.
                        <br>A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a child to commit suicide. Here, on account of
                        Z’s youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted
                        murder.</p>

                        grievous hurt, is said “voluntarily to cause grievous hurt”.
                        <br>Explanation.—A person is not said voluntarily to cause grievous hurt except when he

                        But he is said voluntarily to cause grievous hurt, if intending or knowing himself to be likely
                        to cause grievous hurt of one kind, he actually causes grievous hurt of another kind.
                        <br>Illustration.

                        Z a blow which does not permanently disfigure Z’s face, but which causes Z to suffer severe
                        bodily pain for the space of fifteen days. A has voluntarily caused grievous hurt.
                        <br>(2) Whoever, except in the case provided for by sub-section (2) of section 122, voluntarily
                        causes grievous hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term

                        which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person’s natural life.
                        <br>(4) When a group of five or more persons acting in concert, causes grievous hurt to a

                        <br>A obstructs a path along which Z has a right to pass, A not believing in good faith that

                        restrains Z.

                        that person.

                        <br>(a) A causes Z to go within a walled space, and locks Z in. Z is thus prevented from
                        proceeding in any direction beyond the circumscribing line of wall. A wrongfully confines Z.
                        <br>(b) A places men with firearms at the outlets of a building, and tells Z that they will fire
                        at Z if Z attempts to leave the building. A wrongfully confines Z.
                        <br>(2) Whoever wrongfully confines any person shall be punished with imprisonment of
                        either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to
                        five thousand rupees, or with both.
                        <br>(3) Whoever wrongfully confines any person for three days, or more, shall be punished
                        with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with
                        fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees, or with both.

                        with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years, and shall
                        also be liable to fine which shall not be less than ten thousand rupees.
                        <br>(5) Whoever keeps any person in wrongful confinement, knowing that a writ for the
                        liberation of that person has been duly issued, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
                        description for a term which may extend to two years in addition to any term of imprisonment
                        to which he may be liable under any other section of this Chapter and shall also be liable to
                        fine.
                        <br>(6) Whoever wrongfully confines any person in such manner as to indicate an intention
                        that the confinement of such person may not be known to any person interested in the
                        person so confined, or to any public servant, or that the place of such confinement may not
                        be known to or discovered by any such person or public servant as hereinbefore mentioned,
                        shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
                        three years in addition to any other punishment to which he may be liable for such wrongful
                        confinement and shall also be liable to fine.
                        <br>(7) Whoever wrongfully confines any person for the purpose of extorting from the
                        person confined, or from any person interested in the person confined, any property or
                        valuable security or of constraining the person confined or any person interested in such

                        of an offence, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
                        extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine.
                        <br>(8) Whoever wrongfully confines any person for the purpose of extorting from the

                        information which may lead to the detection of an offence or misconduct, or for the purpose
                        of constraining the person confined or any person interested in the person confined to
                        restore or to cause the restoration of any property or valuable security or to satisfy any claim

                        the person to whom the force is used, is said to use criminal force to that other.
                        <br>Illustrations.
                        <br>(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus
                        intentionally causes the boat to drift down the stream. Here A intentionally causes motion to
                        Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is produced
                        without any other action on any person’s part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z;
                        and if he has done so without Z’s consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or
                        intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, fear or annoyance
                        to Z, A has used criminal force to Z.
                        <br>(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z’s horses, and thereby causes them to quicken
                        their pace. Here A has caused change of motion to Z by inducing the animals to change their
                        motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z’s consent, intending
                        or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal
                        force to Z.
                        <br>(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the
                        palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of motion to Z, and he has done this by his own
                        bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, without
                        Z’s consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z.
                        <br>(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power
                        moved his own person so as to bring it into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally
                        used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z’s consent, intending or knowing it to be
                        likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.
                        <br>(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus
                        brought into contact with Z, or with Z’s clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will
                        strike water and dash up the water against Z’s clothes or something carried by Z. Here, if the
                        throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with
                        Z, or Z’s clothes, A has used force to Z, and if he did so without Z’s consent, intending
                        thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.
                        <br>(f) A intentionally pulls up a woman’s veil. Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if
                        he does so without her consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby
                        injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her.
                        <br>(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A
                        intentionally by his own bodily power causes such motion in the boiling water as brings that
                        water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact must affect Z’s
                        sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this
                        without Z’s consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury,
                        fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force.
                        <br>(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z’s consent. Here, if A intends to cause
                        injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses criminal force to Z.</p>

                        <br> Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be
                        likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he
                        who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to
                        commit an assault.
                        <br>Explanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a
                        person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those
                        gestures or preparations amount to an assault.
                        <br>Illustrations.
                        <br>(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause
                        Z to believe that A is about to strike Z. A has committed an assault.
                        <br>(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be
                        likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A
                        has committed an assault upon Z.
                        <br>(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words
                        used by A could in no case amount to an assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied
                        by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault, the gesture explained by the
                        words may amount to an assault.</p>

                        and sudden provocation given by that person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either

                        one thousand rupees, or with both.
                        <br>Explanation 1.—Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for
                        an offence under this section,—
                        <br>(a) if the provocation is sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an
                        excuse for the offence; or
                        <br>(b) if the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a
                        public servant, in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant; or
                        <br>(c) if the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right
                        of private defence.
                        <br>Explanation 2.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate
                        the offence, is a question of fact.</p>

                        <br> (1) Kidnapping is of two kinds: kidnapping from India, and kidnapping from
                        lawful guardianship––
                        <br>(a) whoever conveys any person beyond the limits of India without the consent
                        of that person, or of some person legally authorised to consent on behalf of that
                        person, is said to kidnap that person from India;
                        <br>(b) whoever takes or entices any child or any person of unsound mind, out of the
                        keeping of the lawful guardian of such child or person of unsound mind, without the
                        consent of such guardian, is said to kidnap such child or person from lawful
                        guardianship.
                        <br>Explanation.––The words “lawful guardian” in this clause include any person
                        lawfully entrusted with the care or custody of such child or other person.
                        <br>Exception.—This clause does not extend to the act of any person who in good
                        faith believes himself to be the father of an illegitimate child, or who in good faith
                        believes himself to be entitled to the lawful custody of such child, unless such act is
                        committed for an immoral or unlawful purpose.
                        <br>(2) Whoever kidnaps any person from India or from lawful guardianship shall be
                        punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven
                        years, and shall also be liable to fine.</p>

                        purposes of begging shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall
                        not be less than ten years but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be
                        liable to fine.
                        <br>(2) Whoever maims any child in order that such child may be employed or used for the
                        purposes of begging shall be punishable with imprisonment which shall not be less than
                        twenty years, but which may extend to life which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder
                        of that person’s natural life, and with fine.
                        <br>(3) Where any person, not being the lawful guardian of a child employs or uses such
                        child for the purposes of begging, it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that he
                        kidnapped or otherwise obtained the custody of such child in order that such child might be
                        employed or used for the purposes of begging.
                        <br>(4) In this section “begging” means—
                        <br>(i) soliciting or receiving alms in a public place, whether under the pretence of
                        singing, dancing, fortune telling, performing tricks or selling articles or otherwise;
                        <br>(ii) entering on any private premises for the purpose of soliciting or receiving

                        of an animal;
