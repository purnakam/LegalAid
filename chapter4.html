                            <br>A person abets the doing of a thing, who—
                            <br>(a) instigates any person to do that thing; or
                            <br>(b) engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the
                            doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that
                            conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or
                            <br>(c) intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.
                            <br>Explanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment
                            of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts
                            to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.
                            <br>Illustration.
                            <br>A, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court to apprehend Z. B, knowing
                            that fact and also that C is not Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally
                            causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the apprehension of C.
                            <br>Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act,
                            does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the
                            commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.</p>

                <div class="popup" id="popup46">

                        <p><a>Section 46</a>
                            <br>A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the
                            commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of
                            committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor.
                            <br>Explanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an
                            offence although the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act.
                            <br>Explanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act
                            abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be
                            caused.
                            <br>Illustrations.
                            <br>(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit
                            murder.
                            <br>(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers
                            from the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder.
                            <br>Explanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law
                            of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as
                            that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge.
                            <br>Illustrations.
                            <br>(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a person of unsound mind to commit an
                            act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an
                            offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is
                            guilty of abetting an offence.
                            <br>(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age,
                            to do an act which causes Z’s death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the
                            absence of A and thereby causes Z’s death. Here, though B was not capable by law of
                            committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable
                            by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to
                            the punishment of death.
                            <br>(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of his unsoundness
                            of mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong
                            or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A’s instigation. B has committed
                            no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is
                            liable to the punishment provided for that offence.
                            <br>(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging
                            to Z out of Z’s possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the
                            property out of Z’s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A’s property. B, acting under
                            this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is
                            guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft.
                            <br>Explanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such
                            an abetment is also an offence.
                            <br>Illustration.
                            <br>A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and
                            C commits that offence in consequence of B’s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his
                            offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is
                            also liable to the same punishment.
                            <br>Explanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by
                            conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is
                            sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.
                            <br>Illustration.
                            A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison.
                            B then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but
                            without mentioning A’s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to
                            B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies
                            in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged
                            in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the
                            offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder.</p>

                            <br>Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of
                            the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Sanhita for the punishment of such
                            abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.
                            <br>Explanation.—An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment,
                            when it is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or
                            with the aid which constitutes the abetment.
                            <br>Illustrations.
                            <br>(a) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits
                            that offence. A is guilty of abetting that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B.
                            <br>(b) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the
                            poison and delivers it to B in order that he may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the
                            conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A’s absence and thereby causes Z’s death. Here
                            B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the
                            punishment for murder.</p>

                            Provided that the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was
                            committed under the influence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the
                            conspiracy which constituted the abetment.
                            <br>Illustrations.
                            <br>(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that
                            purpose. The child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the
                            food of Y, which is by the side of that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence
                            of A’s instigation, and the act done was under the circumstances a probable consequence of
                            the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had instigated the
                            child to put the poison into the food of Y.
                            <br>(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house, B sets fire to the house and at the same time
                            commits theft of property there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not
                            guilty of abetting the theft; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence
                            of the burning.
                            <br>(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of
                            robbery, and provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and
                            being resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable
                            consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the punishment provided for murder.</p>
