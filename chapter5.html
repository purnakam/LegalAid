                            <br> A man is said to commit “rape” if he—
                            <br>(a) penetrates his penis, to any extent, into the vagina, mouth, urethra or anus of
                            a woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person; or
                            <br>(b) inserts, to any extent, any object or a part of the body, not being the penis,
                            into the vagina, the urethra or anus of a woman or makes her to do so with him or any
                            other person; or
                            <br>(c) manipulates any part of the body of a woman so as to cause penetration into
                            the vagina, urethra, anus or any part of body of such woman or makes her to do so with
                            him or any other person; or
                            <br>(d) applies his mouth to the vagina, anus, urethra of a woman or makes her to do
                            so with him or any other person,
                            <br>under the circumstances falling under any of the following seven descriptions:—
                            <br> (i) against her will;
                            <br> (ii) without her consent;
                            <br> (iii) with her consent, when her consent has been obtained by putting her or
                            any person in whom she is interested, in fear of death or of hurt;
                            <br>(iv) with her consent, when the man knows that he is not her husband and that
                            her consent is given because she believes that he is another man to whom she is or
                            believes herself to be lawfully married;
                            <br>(v) with her consent when, at the time of giving such consent, by reason of
                            unsoundness of mind or intoxication or the administration by him personally or through
                            another of any stupefying or unwholesome substance, she is unable to understand
                            the nature and consequences of that to which she gives consent;
                            <br>(vi) with or without her consent, when she is under eighteen years of age;
                            <br>(vii) when she is unable to communicate consent.
                            <br>Explanation 1.—For the purposes of this section, “vagina” shall also include labia
                            majora.
                            <br>Explanation 2.—Consent means an unequivocal voluntary agreement when the woman
                            by words, gestures or any form of verbal or non-verbal communication, communicates
                            willingness to participate in the specific sexual act:
                            <br>Provided that a woman who does not physically resist to the act of penetration shall
                            not by the reason only of that fact, be regarded as consenting to the sexual activity.
                            <br>Exception 1.––A medical procedure or intervention shall not constitute rape.
                            <br>Exception 2.––Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife
                            not being under eighteen years of age, is not rape.</p>

                        <br> Whoever sells, lets to hire, or otherwise disposes of any child with intent that such
                        child shall at any age be employed or used for the purpose of prostitution or illicit intercourse
                        with any person or for any unlawful and immoral purpose, or knowing it to be likely that such

                        <br>Explanation 1.—When a female under the age of eighteen years is sold, let for hire, or
                        otherwise disposed of to a prostitute or to any person who keeps or manages a brothel, the
                        person so disposing of such female shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have
                        disposed of her with the intent that she shall be used for the purpose of prostitution.
                        <br>Explanation 2.—For the purposes of this section “illicit intercourse” means sexual
                        intercourse between persons not united by marriage or by any union or tie which, though
                        not amounting to a marriage, is recognised by the personal law or custom of the community
                        to which they belong or, where they belong to different communities, of both such
                        communities, as constituting between them a quasi-marital relation.</p>

                        seven years but which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable to fine.
                        <br>Explanation 1.—Any prostitute or any person keeping or managing a brothel, who
                        buys, hires or otherwise obtains possession of a female under the age of eighteen years
                        shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have obtained possession of such female
