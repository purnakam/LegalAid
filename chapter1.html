                    <br>Illustration.
                    <br>A writes his name on the back of a bill of exchange. As the effect of this
                    endorsement is to transfer the right to the bill to any person who may become the
                    lawful holder of it, the endorsement is a “valuable security”;
                    <br>(32) “vessel” means anything made for the conveyance by water of human
                    beings or of property;
                    <br>(33) “voluntarily”.—A person is said to cause an effect “voluntarily” when he
                    causes it by means whereby he intended to cause it, or by means which, at the time of
                    employing those means, he knew or had reason to believe to be likely to cause it.
                    <br>Illustration.
                    <br>A sets fire, by night, to an inhabited house in a large town, for the purpose of
                    facilitating a robbery and thus causes the death of a person. Here, A may not have
                    intended to cause death; and may even be sorry that death has been caused by his act;
                    yet, if he knew that he was likely to cause death, he has caused death voluntarily;
                    <br>(34) “will” means any testamentary document;
                    <br>(35) “woman” means a female human being of any age;
                    <br>(36) “wrongful gain” means gain by unlawful means of property to which the
                    person gaining is not legally entitled;
                    <br>(37) “wrongful loss” means the loss by unlawful means of property to which the
                    person losing it is legally entitled;
                    <br>(38) “gaining wrongfully” and “losing wrongfully”.—A person is said to gain
                    wrongfully when such person retains wrongfully, as well as when such person acquires
                    wrongfully. A person is said to lose wrongfully when such person is wrongfully kept out
                    of any property, as well as when such person is wrongfully deprived of property; and
                    <br>(39) words and expressions used but not defined in this Sanhita but defined in

                            <br>(1) Throughout this Sanhita every definition of an offence, every penal provision,
                            and every Illustration of every such definition or penal provision, shall be understood
                            subject to the exceptions contained in the Chapter entitled “General Exceptions”, though
                            those exceptions are not repeated in such definition, penal provision, or Illustration.
                            <br>Illustrations.
                            <br>(a) The sections in this Sanhita, which contain definitions of offences, do not express
                            that a child under seven years of age cannot commit such offences; but the definitions are to
                            be understood subject to the general exception which provides that nothing shall be an
                            offence which is done by a child under seven years of age.
                            <br>(b) A, a police officer, without warrant, apprehends Z, who has committed murder. Here
                            A is not guilty of the offence of wrongful confinement; for he was bound by law to apprehend
                            Z, and therefore the case falls within the general exception which provides that “nothing is
                            an offence which is done by a person who is bound by law to do it”.
                        <br>(2) Every expression which is explained in any Part of this Sanhita, is used in every Part
                        of this Sanhita in conformity with the explanation.
                        <br>(3) When property is in the possession of a person’s spouse, clerk or servant, on
                        account of that person, it is in that person’s possession within the meaning of this Sanhita.
                        Explanation.—A person employed temporarily or on a particular occasion in the capacity
                        of a clerk or servant, is a clerk or servant within the meaning of this sub-section.
                        <br>(4) In every Part of this Sanhita, except where a contrary intention appears from the
                        context, words which refer to acts done extend also to illegal omissions.
                        <br>(5) When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common
                        intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done
                        by him alone.
                        <br>(6) Whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal
                        knowledge or intention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the
                        act with such knowledge or intention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were
                        done by him alone with that knowledge or intention.
                        <br>(7) Wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an
                        act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect
                        partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence.
                        <br>Illustration.
                        <br>A intentionally causes Z’s death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and partly
                        by beating Z. A has committed murder.
                        <br>(8) When an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally
                        cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or
                        jointly with any other person, commits that offence.
                        <br>Illustrations.
                        <br>(a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses
                        of poison. A and B administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z.
                        Z dies from the effects the several doses of poison so administered to him. Here A and B
                        intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by
                        which the death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate.
                        <br>(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively
                        for six hours at a time. A and B, intending to cause Z’s death, knowingly cooperate in causing
                        that effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with food
                        supplied to them for that purpose. Z dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of
                        Z.
                        <br>(c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner. A, intending to cause Z’s death, illegally
                        omits to supply Z with food; in consequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the
                        starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his office, and B succeeds
                        him. B, without collusion or cooperation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food,
                        knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z’s death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder,
                        but, as A did not cooperate with B. A is guilty only of an attempt to commit murder.
                        <br>(9) Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal
                        act, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act.
                        <br>Illustration.
                        <br>A attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would
                        be only culpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intendingto kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here,
                        though A and B are both engaged in causing Z’s death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty
                        only of culpable homicide.</p>
