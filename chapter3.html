                            <br>. Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that
                            it is likely to cause harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in
                            good faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property.
                         <br>Explanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented
                         or avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the
                         act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm.
                         <br>Illustrations.
                          <br>(a) A, the captain of a vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his
                         part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably
                         run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless he changes the course
                         of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C
                         with only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course
                         without any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding
                         the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run
                         down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found
                         as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in
                         incurring the risk of running down the boat C.
                         <br>(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from
                         spreading. He does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property.
                         Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent as to
                         excuse A’s act, A is not guilty of the offence.</p>
