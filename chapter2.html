                            <br>. (1) Where no sum is expressed to which a fine may extend, the amount of fine to
                            which the offender is liable is unlimited, but shall not be excessive.
                            <br>(2) In every case of an offence––
                            <br>(a) punishable with imprisonment as well as fine, in which the offender is
                            sentenced to a fine, whether with or without imprisonment;
                            <br>(b) punishable with imprisonment or fine, or with fine only, in which the offender

                            <br>it shall be competent to the Court which sentences such offender to direct by the sentence
                            that, in default of payment of the fine, the offender shall suffer imprisonment for a certain
                            term, in which imprisonment shall be in excess of any other imprisonment to which he may
                            have been sentenced or to which he may be liable under a commutation of a sentence.
                        <br>(3) The term for which the Court directs the offender to be imprisoned in default of
                        payment of a fine shall not exceed one-fourth of the term of imprisonment which is the
                        maximum fixed for the offence, if the offence be punishable with imprisonment as well as fine.
                        <br>(4) The imprisonment which the Court imposes in default of payment of a fine or in
                        default of community service may be of any description to which the offender might have
                        been sentenced for the offence.
                        <br>(5) If the offence is punishable with fine or community service, the imprisonment
                        which the Court imposes in default of payment of the fine or in default of community service
                        shall be simple, and the term for which the Court directs the offender to be imprisoned, in
                        default of payment of fine or in default of community service, shall not exceed,—
                        <br>(a) two months when the amount of the fine does not exceed five thousand
                        rupees;
                        <br>(b) four months when the amount of the fine does not exceed ten thousand
                        rupees; and
                        <br>(c) one year in any other case.
                        <br>(6) (a) The imprisonment which is imposed in default of payment of a fine shall terminate
                        whenever that fine is either paid or levied by process of law;
                        <br>(b) If, before the expiration of the term of imprisonment fixed in default of payment,
                        such a proportion of the fine be paid or levied that the term of imprisonment suffered in
                        default of payment is not less than proportional to the part of the fine still unpaid, the
                        imprisonment shall terminate.
                        <br>Illustration.
                        <br>A is sentenced to a fine of one thousand rupees and to four months’ imprisonment in
                        default of payment. Here, if seven hundred and fifty rupees of the fine be paid or levied
                        before the expiration of one month of the imprisonment, A will be discharged as soon as the
                        first month has expired. If seven hundred and fifty rupees be paid or levied at the time of the
                        expiration of the first month, or at any later time while A continues in imprisonment, A will be
                        immediately discharged. If five hundred rupees of the fine be paid or levied before the
                        expiration of two months of the imprisonment, A will be discharged as soon as the two
                        months are completed. If five hundred rupees be paid or levied at the time of the expiration of
                        those two months, or at any later time while A continues in imprisonment, A will be immediately
                        discharged.
                        <br>(7) The fine, or any part thereof which remains unpaid, may be levied at any time within
                        six years after the passing of the sentence, and if, under the sentence, the offender be liable
                        to imprisonment for a longer period than six years, then at any time previous to the expiration
                        of that period; and the death of the offender does not discharge from the liability any
                        property which would, after his death, be legally liable for his debts.</p>

                            <br>(2) Where—
                            <br>(a) anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any
                            law in force for the time being by which offences are defined or punished; or
                        <br>(b) several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves
                        constitute an offence, constitute, when combined, a different offence,
                        <br>the offender shall not be punished with a more severe punishment than the Court which tries
                        him could award for any one of such offences.

                        <br>(a) A gives Z fifty strokes with a stick. Here A may have committed the offence of
                        voluntarily causing hurt to Z by the whole beating, and also by each of the blows which
                        make up the whole beating. If A were liable to punishment for every blow, he might be
                        imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment for the
                        whole beating.
                        <br>(b) But, if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes, and A intentionally strikes Y, here, as the
                        blow given to Y is no part of the act whereby A voluntarily causes hurt to Z, A is liable to one
                        punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the blow given to Y</p>
